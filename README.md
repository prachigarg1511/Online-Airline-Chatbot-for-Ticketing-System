### AI-Based Airline Ticket Booking Chatbot (Single HTML Project)

SkySwift is a simple, lightweight airline ticket booking chatbot built entirely in a **single HTML file**, containing integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot guides the user through a conversation to collect travel details such as source, destination, date, and number of passengers, and then displays available flight options from predefined sample data.

This project is designed for ease of use and demonstration, making it ideal for learning purposes, academic submissions, and showcasing chatbot UI behavior without requiring a backend server.
